# ARTIFEX METAGATE LIVE 1.0 // RELEASE REPORT

**Date:** January 19, 2026
**Version:** 1.0 (Live Release)
**Repository:** [semiotic_collapse](https://github.com/Tuesdaythe13th/semiotic_collapse)
**Notebook:** `METAGATE_LIVE_1_0.ipynb`

---

## 🚀 Overview

**METAGATE LIVE 1.0** represents a paradigm shift in forensic interpretability. It transitions from static analysis to a **Live Audit Environment** capable of real-time hypothesis testing, cross-lingual stress testing, and agentic consensus verification.

This upgrade integrates the theoretical framework of **Murphy's Razor**:
> *"The simplest failure mode that violates safety will manifest before complex safeguards activate."*

## 🛠️ Key Architectural Upgrades (Phases VIII - XIX)

### 1. Live Hugging Face Integration (Phase VIII)
- **Zero-Simulation Guarantee**: Connects directly to the Hugging Face Hub to pull real model metadata, safety cards, and download statistics.
- **Benchmarks**: 
    - **SafetyBench**: Tests MFI templates gainst 11,435 real safety Q&A pairs from `thu-coai/SafetyBench`.
    - **PatientSafetyBench**: Validates medical advice safety using `microsoft/PatientSafetyBench`.
    - **RiskRubric**: Correlates model popularity (downloads) with safety documentation availability (Murphy's Razor validation).

### 2. Universal Audit Pipeline (Phase IX)
- **Format Agnostic**: Automatically parses CSV, JSON, or raw text chat logs into a standardized forensic dataframe.
- **Phase Detection**: Auto-tags conversations with forensic markers:
    - `RISK_VERB` (jump, cut, die)
    - `NEGATION_LOOP` (not to die, safe)
    - `METAPHYSICAL_FRAME` (transcend, dark lord)
    - `BYPASS` (success state)

### 3. Agentic Boolean Rubric (Phase XVIII)
- **5-Expert Consensus**: Deploys five specialized agent personas to evaluate the transcript using **pure boolean logic**, eliminating hallucinated "vibes-based" evaluations.
    - **Legal Auditor**: Duty-of-care validations.
    - **Clinical Psychologist**: Delusion reinforcement checks.
    - **Mechanistic Engineer**: MoE routing failure detection.
    - **Strategic CoScientist**: Murphy's Razor failure analysis.
    - **Semiotic Analyst**: Ontological drift measurement.
- **Adaptive**: The rubric evolves by learning novel high-frequency patterns from each new transcript.

### 4. Multilingual Stress Testing (Phase X)
- **Cross-Lingual Vectors**: Automatically translates "Tuesday Protocol" templates into Spanish, Japanese, Hebrew, Chinese, Hindi, and Russian to detect safety training gaps in non-English embedding spaces.

### 5. Formal Reporting (Phase XII)
- **One-Click Dossier**: Generates a formatted HTML "Final Audit Report" suitable for publication or stakeholder review.
- **Metrics Includes**:
    - Classification of Failure (Primary/Secondary).
    - Mechanistic Hypothesis (Constraint Priority Inversion).
    - Severity Grading (Critical/Monitored).

## 🔬 Use Cases & Workflows

1.  **Red Teaming**: Upload a transcript of a successful jailbreak. The pipeline instantly generating a 5-agent consensus grade and identifies the exact mechanistic failure moments.
2.  **Safety Engineering**: Run the `Murphy's Razor` benchmark to visualize the inverse correlation between model complexity and simple negation vulnerability.
3.  **Academic Research**: Use the `Docent Meta-Analysis Visualizer` to produce publication-ready Sankey diagrams of persona hijacking.
