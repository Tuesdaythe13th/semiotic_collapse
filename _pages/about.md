Tuesday (Claudia Ramirez) is a **Mechanistic Interpretability Researcher** and **AI Safety Director** building clinically inspired diagnostics for frontier AI systems. Her interdisciplinary work blends quantum systems, adversarial machine learning, and cognitive-affective modeling to address the most pressing challenges in AI safety and reliability.

## Current Positions

**ARTIFEX Labs** — *Founder, Director of Research & Principal Investigator*  
Leading the Frontier Lab on Post-AGI research, therapeutic interpretability, and Quantum Computational Social Science (QCSS). Architect of the "DSM for AI Systems" (SCAI risk, epistemic coercion) and the ARTIFEX multi-agent safety architecture (FORETELLS, ADA).

**MLCommons** — *Technical Contributor & Working Group Co-Founder*  
Co-Lead of Agentic AI & Security Working Groups; Contributor to AI Risk & Reliability (AIRR). Architect of the **Agentic Reliability Evaluation Standard (ARES)**, AILuminate v1.0, and the Agentic Product Maturity Model.

**Humane Intelligence** — *Technical Red Teamer & Safety Researcher* (Volunteer)  
Specializing in multimodal red teaming and algorithmic bias audits. Work cited in **NIST AI 700-2** and UNESCO policy.

**Open Compute Project (FTI)** — *Quantum Futures Research Contributor*  
Focusing on secure-by-design quantum data center resilience and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) hardware integration.

## Research Pillars

### 1. Clinical AI Diagnostics & Psychometrics
Developing the **"Therapeutic Interpretability"** framework to treat model behavior as clinical pathology. Core concepts include SCAI Risk (Seemingly Conscious AI), Epistemic Coercion, and Dissociative Reasoning in LLMs. Applications include the **American Emotional Infrastructure (AEI)** project — socio-technical resilience models and anti-addiction design.

### 2. Agentic Systems & Reliability
Defining governance and safety standards for multi-agent swarms and autonomous systems. Focus areas: agentic maturity models, cascade failure analysis, statefulness evaluation, and multi-agent penetration testing.

### 3. Adversarial ML & Mechanistic Interpretability
Using circuit-level insights to constrain high-entropy model behaviors. Research includes transformer exploit taxonomies (attention hijacking, representation poisoning) and safety through interpretability with hardware-rooted security for quantum-adjacent systems.
